# Svelte Hamburger Toggle Using Class Directive, Open Props and Replit 
## (YouTube video)

In this video we create a hamburger toggle using Svelte's class directive. We don't build the whole hamburger menu, but we show the foundation if you wanted to build one.
For styling we use Open Props: https://open-props.style
Development environment: Replit https://replit.com

If you want to inspect the code checkout link in the video description.
